    "Our family live in Worcester County, MA. My husband has recently got a job in Boylston and his new office is located almost 15 miles away from home. This means his daily travel time is close to 1.5 hours. We are considering moving closer to his office to save time. We currently stay in the neighborhood of the city of Worcester, which is in the west of Worcester County, and his office is in Boylston, which is in the east of Worcester County. We don’t have to stay in Boylston where has a relatively high rent price. But we prefer moving to a neighborhood closer to his workplace and similar to our current neighborhood of Worcester.\n",
